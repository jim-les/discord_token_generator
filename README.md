# discord_token_generator
Importing Libraries:

The script starts by importing various Python libraries, including os, requests, threading, sys, httpx, json, time, random, string, colorama, tls_client, websocket, and base64.
Initializing and Clearing the Console:

The script clears the console screen using the os.system function, which is OS-dependent (Windows or Unix-like systems).
Loading Proxies:

Proxies for making requests are loaded from a file named "proxies.txt" into the proxylist list. The script also keeps track of the number of loaded proxies in the proxycount variable.
Initializing CAPTCHA Balance:

The variable CaptchaBalance is initialized but not used in the code.
Defining a Banner:

The getBanner() function generates a colored text banner and returns it as a string. It includes information about the number of CAPTCHAs and proxies.
Generating WebSocket Data:

The get_ws() function generates data for WebSocket connections, including information about the device, browser, and presence (game being played).
WebSocket Login Function:

The WSLogin(token) function attempts to establish a WebSocket connection to the Discord gateway using the provided token. It sends a heartbeat message and handles exceptions if the connection fails.
CAPTCHA Solving Function:

The solve_cap(captchaKey) function is used for solving CAPTCHAs. It sends a request to the CapMonster API to create a CAPTCHA solving task and waits for the task to be completed.
Generating User-Agent and Cookies:

The xprop() and cookie() functions generate user-agent strings and cookies to be used in HTTP requests. The user-agent string is encoded with base64.
Generating Discord Tokens:

The gen(username, invite) function generates Discord tokens. It sends a POST request to the Discord API with the provided username and invite. It also solves CAPTCHAs and handles rate limiting.
Main Function:

The main() function is the entry point of the script. It displays the banner, prompts the user for input (username, invite, and the number of threads), and starts multiple threads to generate tokens concurrently.
Entry Point:

The script checks if it is being run as the main program (if __name__ == "__main__":) and then calls the main() function.
